"Do you have a game that can be "modded"? As you know, the number of "must have" mods for any game can run into the tens, if not hundreds. The Generic Mod Enabler takes most of the hassle out of installing and uninstalling mods from your game. It has been tested with European Air War, Panzer Elite, Silent Hunter III/IV, Total War and various other games but should work with just about any moddable game."
